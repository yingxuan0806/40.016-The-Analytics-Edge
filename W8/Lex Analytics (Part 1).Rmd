First, we prepare the working environment.
```{r}
rm(list = ls())   # Clear the environment
# setwd("...")  # Setup the working directory
setwd("~/Documents/SUTD/Term 6/TAE/W8")
```


# Data Preparation

## Load the data on the US Supreme Court
```{r}
supreme <- read.csv("supreme.csv") # We have 623 observations and 20 variables
str(supreme)       # Internal structure of the dataframe 
# head(supreme)    # First part of the dataframe
# summary(supreme) # Summary of the data
```

## A few comments on the data

- ```docket```: case number
- ```term```: year the case was discussed
- ```party_1``` and ```party_2```: parties involved in the case
- ```rehndir```, ```stevdir```, ```ocondir```, ```scaldir```, ```kendir```, ```soutdir```, ```thomdir```, ```gindir```, ```brydir```: direction of the judgement of the 9 judges (i.e., Rehquist, Stevens, O'Connor, Scalia, Kennedy, Souter, Thomor, Ginsburg, Breyen). 0 means liberal, 1 conservative. 9 indicates that the vote is not available for the case
- ```petit```: petitioner type
- ```respon```: respondant type
- ```circuit```: circuit of origin
- ```uncost```: binary number indicating if the petitioner argued the practice was unconstitutional
- ```lctdir```: lower court direction (liberal or conservative)
- ```issue```: area of issue
- ```result```: 0 means liberal, 1 conservative

## More insights on the data

Let's now focus on a specific judge, say Stevens. We begin by removing data with no entry from Stevens.
```{r}
stevens <- subset(supreme[, c("docket", "term", "stevdir", "petit", "respon", "circuit", "unconst", "lctdir", "issue", "result")], supreme$stevdir != 9)
```

Then, we process the output result to affirm or reverse for judge Stevens. This creates a new variable (```$rev```) in the dataframe that takes a value of 1 if Stevens' decision reverses the lower court decision and 0 if the judge affirms the lower court decision. Note that a similar analysis can be done for the other judges or for the overall case result.

```{r}
stevens$rev <- as.integer((stevens$lctdir == "conser" & stevens$stevdir == 0) | (stevens$lctdir == "liberal" & stevens$stevdir == 1))
```

The table below gives us some stats about judge Stevens' decisions. He voted 341 times to reverse the lower court direction and 278 times to affirm it.

```{r}
table(stevens$rev)
```

## Training and testing datasets

Finally, we split the data into training and testing datasets. To this purpose, we use the ```caTools``` package.

```{r, message=FALSE}
if(!require(caTools)){                          # install or load the package
  install.packages("caTools")
  library(caTools)
}

set.seed(123)                                   # set seed for random sampling
spl <- sample.split(stevens$rev, SplitRatio = 0.7) # We use 70% of the data for training
train <- subset(stevens, spl == TRUE);             # training dataset
test <- subset(stevens, spl == FALSE);             # testing dataset
```


# Modelling exercise (warm up): Logistic regression

Before introducing the Classification and Regression Trees (CARTs), let's warm up with a simple exercise: predicting justice Stevens' decisions with Logistic Regression.

```{r}
m1 <- glm(rev ~ petit + respon + circuit + unconst + issue + lctdir, data = train, family = "binomial")
summary(m1)
```

Let's now try to make a prediction on the test data. We cannot use the command ```p1 <- predict(m1,newdata=test,type="response")```, because ```issue``` has only one realization of the IR value (Interstate Relations), which is not estimated in the training set. Let's thus modify the test dataset as follows:

```{r}
test <- subset(test, test$issue != "IR")
p1 <- predict(m1, newdata = test, type = "response")
```

How does the model perform?

```{r}
# confusion matrix
table(p1 >= 0.5, test$rev)
```

So the accuracy is ```r sum(diag(table(p1>=0.5,test$rev)))/sum(table(p1>=0.5,test$rev))```. Let's plot the ROC Curve.

```{r, message=FALSE}
if(!require(ROCR)){
  install.packages("ROCR")
  library(ROCR)
}

pred <- prediction(p1, test$rev)
perf <- performance(pred, x.measure = "fpr", measure = "tpr")
performance(pred, measure = "auc")
plot(perf)
```


# Classification And Regression Trees (CARTs)

```{r, message=FALSE}
if(!require(rpart)){        # rpart is for CART
  install.packages("rpart")
  library(rpart)
}
```

## Building a CART

The command ```cart1 <- rpart(rev~petit+respon+circuit+lctdir+issue+unconst,data=train)```, will not work, because ```rpart``` builds a regression tree by default. So, remember to specify you are working on a classification problem! 

```{r}
library(rpart)
cart1 <- rpart(rev ~ petit + respon + circuit + lctdir + issue + unconst, data = train, method = "class")
# Alternative way of building a classification tree
# cart1 <- rpart(as.factor(rev) ~ petit + respon + circuit + lctdir + issue + unconst, data = train)
```

## What's inside a CART?

The variable ```cart1``` contains all the information about the tree, with nodes, branches and the corresponding probability associated to each class. To analyze its content, we have a couple of options. 

The first is to use the function ```print()```: for each node, we know: node number, variable used for splitting, number of observations in the node, loss error in the node, predicted value, and predicted probabilities. Note that the children of node x are numbered 2x and 2x+1. Also, note that a variable might appear many times in the tree.

For example: 38) issue=CP,FA 16   4 0 (0.75 0.25) * (we also see that this is a terminal node)

```{r, message=FALSE}
print(cart1)
```

The second option we have is to use the function ```summary()```.

```{r, results=FALSE}
summary(cart1)
```

## Visualizing a CART's structure

A fundamental advantage of CARTs is that it possible to visualize their structure. There is a number of packages that can be used to this purpose.

We begin with the default function (available in the ```rpart package```)

```{r}
plot(cart1); text(cart1) 
```

The `rpart` package has better functionalities

```{r, message=FALSE}
if(!require(rpart.plot)){   
  install.packages("rpart.plot")
  library(rpart.plot)
}
prp(cart1) 
prp(cart1,type=1) # labels all nodes (not just the leaves)
prp(cart1,type=4) # draws separate labels for left and right directions for all nodes and label nodes
prp(cart1,type=4,extra=4) # in addition, this also plots the probability per class of observation
prp(cart1,type=4,extra=9) # probablities times fraction of observations at the node (the sum across all leaves is 1)
```

Other visualization options: see an example with the ```fancyRpartPlot()``` function, which requires ```rpart.plot```, ```rattle```, and ```RColorBrewer```.

```{r, message=FALSE}
if(!require(rattle)){
  install.packages("rattle")
  library(rattle)
}
if(!require(RColorBrewer)){
  install.packages("RColorBrewer")
  library(RColorBrewer)
}
fancyRpartPlot(cart1) # Run fancyRpartPlot
```

## Making predictions

The function ```predict()``` uses ```cart1``` and the test data to carry out the predictions. The function chooses the class with the highest probability.

```{r}
predictcart1 <- predict(cart1,newdata=test,type="class")
# predictcart1
```

How does the model perform?

```{r}
table(test$rev,predictcart1)
```

So the accuracy is ```r sum(diag(table(test$rev,predictcart1)))/sum(table(test$rev,predictcart1))```. Let's plot the ROC Curve.

```{r}
predictcart1_prob <- predict(cart1,newdata=test) # predicted probabilities of rev=0 and rev=1 for each test observation
pred_cart1 <- prediction(predictcart1_prob[,2],test$rev)
perf_cart1 <- performance(pred_cart1, x.measure="fpr",measure="tpr")
plot(perf_cart1)
# performance(pred_cart1,measure="auc") 
```

In synthesis, we can see that the performance of the logistic regression and CART model are similar.
