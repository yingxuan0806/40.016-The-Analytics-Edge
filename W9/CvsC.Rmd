Correlation vs Causation: storks data


Do storks actually deliver babies? Let us look at a data set from 17 European countries (from 1980 to 1990). We plot the stork pairs vs. number of births (in 1000s per year).
```{r}
storks <- read.csv("storks.csv")
#View(storks)
str(storks)
library(ggplot2)

p1 <- ggplot(storks, aes(Storks, Birth)) + geom_point(na.rm = T) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, na.rm = T, fullrange = T)
p1
model1 <- lm(data = storks, Birth ~ Storks)

summary(model1)
```

Let us investigate a bit more. Is their a relationship with the area of the country?

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(storks, aes(Area, Birth)) + geom_point(na.rm = T) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, na.rm = T, fullrange = T)
p2
model2 <- lm(data = storks, Birth ~ Area)

summary(model2)


p3 <- ggplot(storks, aes(Area, Storks)) + geom_point(na.rm = T) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, na.rm = T, fullrange = T)
p3
```

So what is the overall association?

```{r}
library(psych)
pairs.panels(storks[, c(2, 3 , 5)], lm = T, ellipses = F)
help(pairs.panels)
```





**Statistical traps: generate employment history**


```{r}

### Generate employee work years
library(ggalt)
End <- as.numeric()
set.seed(1)
for (i in 1:5)
End <- c(End, 1980 + 5 * i + runif(10, min = 1, max = 35))
```

Observe the available data until now.


```{r}

End2020 <- pmin(End, rep(2020, 50))

df2020 <- data.frame(id = 1:50, St = c(rep(c(1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005), each = 10)), End2020)

ggplot(df2020, aes(y = id, x = St, xend = End2020)) +
  geom_dumbbell(size = 3, color = "#e3e2e1",
                colour_x = "#5b8124", colour_xend = "#bad744",
                dot_guide = TRUE, dot_guide_size = 0.25) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Employment at ABC (until 2020)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.05)) 
ggsave("plottrunc2020.png")


tapply(df2020$End2020 - df2020$St, df2020$St, mean)
tapply(df2020$End2020 - df2020$St, df2020$St, sd)
```

May be not the right thing to look at. So we remove the employees who are still working in the firm.


```{r}
### Look at censored data


dfcen <- df2020[df2020$End2020 < 2020, ]
ggplot(dfcen, aes(y = id, x=St, xend = End2020)) +
  geom_dumbbell(size = 3, color = "#e3e2e1",
                colour_x = "#5b8124", colour_xend = "#bad744",
                dot_guide = TRUE, dot_guide_size = 0.25) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Employment at ABC (employees who left)") +  
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.05))
ggsave("plotcensor2020.png")
```


Now look at the data that was generated. All employees were simulated to have worked a random number of years which was uniform between 1 and 35.

```{r}
### Look at original data


df <- data.frame(id = 1:50, St = c(rep(c(1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, 2005), each = 10)), End)

ggplot(df, aes(y = id, x = St, xend = End)) +
  geom_dumbbell(size = 3, color = "#e3e2e1",
                colour_x = "#5b8124", colour_xend = "#bad744",
                dot_guide = TRUE, dot_guide_size = 0.25) +
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, title = "Employment at ABC (projected)") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_line(size = 0.05)) 

ggsave("plotall.png")


tapply(df$End - df$St, df$St, mean)
tapply(df$End - df$St, df$St, sd)
```
