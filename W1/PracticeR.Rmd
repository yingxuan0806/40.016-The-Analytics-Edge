1. Suppose you want to create a vector of the numbers 100 to 1, where 100 is written 100 times, 99 is written 99 times and so on till 1 is written 1 time, namely 100,100,...,3,3,3,2,2,1. Provide an R command that can help you do this.  
*Hint:* Check the `rep` command in R.

```{r}
for (i in 100:1) {
  print(rep(i, times = i))
}

# alternative
rep(100:1, c(100:1))
```
2. Suppose you have a vector `A <- c(1,2,0,4)` and a vector `B <- c(3,6)`, then what is the
result of `A*B` in R?
```{r}
A <- c(1, 2, 0, 4)
B <- c(3, 6)
A*B
# 3 12 0 24
```

3. Run the following R commands and explain the numbers that appear, each time we run
table(gender).  

```{r}
gender <- factor(c(rep("female", 91), rep("male", 92)))
table(gender)

# number of times each level appeared in the vector
# female   male 
#     91     92 


gender1 <- factor(gender, levels=c("male", "female"))
table(gender1)
  
gender2 <- factor(gender, levels=c("Male", "female"))
table(gender2)
# "Male" level will be of 0 value because the spelling is different (M is capitalised)


```
4. Suppose we want to convert a factor variable to a numeric variable in, how do we do so? For
example, convert the factor variable below to numeric.  


```{r}
X <- factor(c(4, 5, 6, 6, 4))
X
x_numeric <- as.numeric(as.character(X))
x_numeric
```

5. Load the dataframe mtcars available with the base R installation in data. The data was
extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10
aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973-74 models).

(a) Use `ggplot()` to plot the weight versus miles per gallon and comment on the relationship.

(b) Add to this plot, a coloring of the points based on the number of cylinders, and the sizing
of the points based on the displacement (volume) of the car.

(c) Use the `tapply()` function to compute the standard deviation of the mpg for groups with
the same number of cylinders.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aet(wt, mpg, color = cyl, size = disp)) + geom_point()
tapply(mtcars$mpg, mtcars$cyl, sd)


```
