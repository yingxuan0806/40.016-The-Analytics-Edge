```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
```
One of the advantages of software such as R is that you can add and install packages that provided added functionality. The `ggplot2` packages is one such package that improves on the basic plotting in R. In this package, you build a graph by adding layer upon layer where you specify the data, aesthetic mapping, statistical transformations (if any) and geometric object (type of plot).

We will use a data set from <http://www.who.int/gho/en>. The dataset contains data on 194 countries from WHO where the variables are: 
1. Country - name of country, 
2. Region - region the country lies in, 
3. Population - population in thousands, 
4. Under15 - Percentage of the population under 15 years of age, 
5. Over60 - Percentage of the population over 60 years of age,
6. FertilityRate - Average number of children per woman,
7. LifeExpectancy - Life expectancy in years,
8. LiteracyRate - Literacy rate among adults at least 15 years of age,
9. GNI - Gross national income per capita


First we have a look at the data set
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
WHO <- read.csv("WHO.csv")
str(WHO)
which(WHO$Country=="Singapore")
WHO[155,]
summary(WHO$Over60)
summary(WHO$Under15)
```

**Singapore** has a high fraction of population over 60 and low fraction of population under 15 as compared to many countries - ageing population and low fertility rate issues.  

#### Visualisation

Let us see how many countries are there in each region
```{r}
bar <- ggplot(WHO) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Region, fill = Region), show.legend = FALSE, width = 1) +  theme(aspect.ratio = 1) + labs(x = NULL, y = NULL)
bar
```



Now we compare the following

1. GNI vs Fertility rate
2. GNI vc Literacy Rate
3. GNI vc Life Expectancy

We also subgroup by region sometimes


```{r}
a<-ggplot(WHO,aes(x=GNI,y=FertilityRate))

a+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+facet_grid(.~Region)+ ggtitle("Fertility Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")
 #facet_grid will give different regions, plots separated based on the region
 
#  a+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+geom_smooth(na.rm=TRUE)+ ggtitle("Fertility Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")

# color by region
acol <- ggplot(WHO,aes(x=GNI,y=FertilityRate, color=Region))

 acol+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+ ggtitle("Fertility Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")
#  acol+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+geom_smooth(na.rm=TRUE)+ ggtitle("Fertility Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")
#

#  a+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+facet_wrap(~Region,nrow=2)+ ggtitle("Fertility Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")
# #
# #
# b<-ggplot(WHO,aes(x=GNI,y=LiteracyRate,color=Region))+ggtitle("Literacy Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")
# 
# b+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)

#  subset(WHO,GNI>75000)
# # 
#  WHOL<-subset(WHO,LiteracyRate>90)
# # 
# c<-ggplot(WHOL,aes(x=GNI,y=LiteracyRate,color=Region))
# 
# c+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+ggtitle("Literacy Rate vs. Gross National Income (top 90 percent literacy)") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Fertility Rate")


# 
# d<-ggplot(WHO,aes(x=GNI,y=LifeExpectancy,color=Region))
# d+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+ggtitle("Literacy Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Life Expectancy")
# ggplot(WHO,aes(x=GNI,y=LifeExpectancy))+geom_point(na.rm=TRUE)+ facet_wrap(~Region,nrow=2)+ggtitle("Literacy Rate vs. Gross National Income") + xlab("Gross National Income") + ylab("Life Expectancy")
# 


```

**Certain observations from the plots above**

1. The plots above indicate an inverse relation between income and fertility.  This suggests that reproductive restraint arises often as a consequence of economic progress or lower fertility leads to more resources being available per child, making them more productive (causality is not observable). This is often referred to as the *demographic-economic paradox*.


2. We also color the points as per the regions by adding the color argument to the aesthetic option. 
This helps see the trend by regions. For example Europe has high GNI, low fertility rates while Africa has low GNI and high ferility rates.

3. We can similarly analyze the other paiwise plots we see.
